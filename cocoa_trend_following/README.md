Having been inspired by @macrocephalopod and his post on trend followers and cocoa futures, I decided to run the same backtest to see if I can get the same results as someone who is much, much smarter than me.

The idea is quite simple, I created a backtest for a trend following strategy of coca futures where we go long when 5 day ema is above the 65 day ema and go short when the opposite is true.
